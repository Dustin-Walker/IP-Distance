### Find the distance within an IP address

---
This program takes an IP address and models the shortest path between keys when typing the IP address into a keypad. The model assumes the player's finger only moves on two axes and not on the depth axis.

The distance of this path is calculated and displayed to the user.

This program was created to practice proficiency with Angular, Bootstrap, JavaScript, HTML, CSS. It was a quick program written in my spare time over a couple days.
